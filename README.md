30 Days of Code 

I have created in order to keep myself consistent towards coding and atleast do 3 questions a day.

#rule no. 1 == never cheat or see solution of any question u picked until or unless u have any brute force apporach or u haven't completed that topic studying out
#rule no. 2 == never make excuses for not doing questions.
#rule no. 3 == remember above 2
